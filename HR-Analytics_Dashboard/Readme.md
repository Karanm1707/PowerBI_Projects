📊 HR Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI

Recently worked on an HR Analytics dashboard using Power BI to explore workforce trends and uncover insights from employee data.

The dashboard highlights key HR metrics and identifies areas that may need strategic attention:

🔹 Key Metrics

Employees: 1,470

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Avg. Age: 37 years

Avg. Tenure: 7 years

Avg. Salary: ₹6.5K

🔹 Insights Observed

Age group 26–35 shows the highest attrition — possibly due to career transitions or better opportunities.

Employees earning below ₹5K are leaving at a higher rate — indicating a compensation gap.

Life Sciences & Medical departments face more exits — deeper investigation might help.

Lab Technicians, Sales Executives, and Researchers experience the most attrition.

Early-career employees (less than 1 year) are exiting quickly — onboarding experience might need improvement.

🔍 Key Takeaways

Visualization helps surface problems that aren't obvious in raw data.

Working on this helped sharpen my approach to asking questions, not just displaying data.

Power BI enables impactful insights when paired with the right business understanding.

Always open to feedback and suggestions from the community.
